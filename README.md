2. if the number is less than 1 return
3. initialise an empty list
4. start a for loop of i from 2 till number+1
5. in which prime = true
6. run another loop, j, inside i from 2 till (i)
7. which will check if i % j == 0 then that no. is not a prime number and then break the j loop and move to the next number.
10. if value of prime = true then add the number to the list
11. diplay the list
